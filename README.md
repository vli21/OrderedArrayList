# OrderedArrayList
Date:           Discussed
12.10.2020      How we would extend to ArrayList? First importing the .java.util and then extending it right under.
                How would we override methods?
                You can just use == in order to check if an element is null
                For OrderedArrayList we would Loop through arraylist and then we would compare.
                BinaryInsertion???? to add, assume list is already sorted and then look for the index where it could be. (still have no idea what this is lmfao)
